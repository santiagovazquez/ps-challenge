# 3D Scene Visualization Challenge

Welcome to our technical challenge! In this exercise, you are tasked to create a 3D visualization tool using the dependencies provided in the `package.json`. Your application will render a 3D scene given a JSON input containing information about points and cuboids.

### Provided Files

- `package.json`: Contains the dependencies that should be used to build the application.
- `https://static.scale.com/uploads/pandaset-challenge/frame_00.json`: Contains the data of a 3D scene with points and cuboids.

### Requirements

#### General

- Develop a full-screen 3D application.
- Use all dependencies listed in the `package.json`.
- Fetch and render points and cuboids from the provided `frame_00.json`.
- Implement camera controls (pan, zoom, and rotate) to navigate through the 3D scene.

#### Points

- Each point should be rendered in the 3D space according to its coordinates.
- The color of the points should be determined by their height (Z-coordinate). You may choose a color gradient or a set of predefined colors to map against various height ranges.

#### Cuboids

- Render each cuboid according to its position, rotation and dimensions in the 3D space.
- Cuboid faces should be semi-transparent.
- Edges/lines of the cuboids should be solid and well defined.
- Show extra relevant cuboid information on hover (using tooltips or a side panel).

### Bonus

- Develop an interactive timeline that allows users to navigate through the various frames of the scene. This timeline should provide a visual indication of the current frameâ€™s position within the entire scene and facilitate effortless exploration through all available frames. Incorporate shortcuts or controls enabling users to seamlessly transition between adjacent frames, ensuring an intuitive user experience. A total of 50 frames are available in the provided bucket for exploration and integration into the viewer.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does the application fulfill the primary requirements?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-organized, easy to read, and follows best practices?
- **Visualization**: Is the visualization effective, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing?
- **Performance**: Does the app run smoothly, even with large datasets?
- **Usability**: Is the application user-friendly and accessible?

### Use of External Resources

- Candidates are permitted to use Google, consult official documentation, or seek assistance from AI models like ChatGPT during the challenge.
- While leveraging external resources is allowed, candidates are expected to navigate through the challenge primarily with their knowledge and skills.
- If external resources were consulted for specific solutions, problem-solving, or coding implementations during the challenge, candidates are required to explicitly mention these instances.
